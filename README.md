# Python Cheatsheet (React + Vite)

A concise, easy-to-browse collection of Python tips, snippets and examples — implemented as a small React + Vite app for quick browsing.

I made this cheatsheet to make Python essentials easy to find and learn. If this project helped you, I'd love contributions to expand and improve it.

**What this repo contains**
- A small React + Vite frontend (see `src/`)
- The main cheatsheet component: `src/components/Python_cheatsheet.jsx`
- Styling in `src/App.css` and `src/index.css`

**Quick start (locally)**
Prerequisites: Node.js (v16+ recommended) and npm or yarn.

```
# install dependencies
npm install

# start dev server
npm run dev

# build for production
npm run build
```

**How to contribute**
- Open an issue to propose new topics or improvements.
- Fork the repo, create a topic branch, and send a pull request with a clear description.
- Add small, focused PRs (one topic or feature per PR) and add examples/tests when possible.

Contribution ideas / areas for improvement
- Add more topics: modules, useful stdlib snippets, data structures, algorithms.
- Add examples with inputs/outputs and edge cases.
- Improve UI: search, tagging, dark mode, copy-to-clipboard buttons for snippets.
- Add filtering, topic indexes, and printable/print-friendly views.
- Add unit tests or snapshot tests for key components.

**How to add a cheatsheet entry**
1. Open `src/components/Python_cheatsheet.jsx` and follow the existing entry format.
2. Add a short description, code block, and a simple example.
3. Keep each entry concise (1–5 lines of code when practical).

**Style & formatting**
- Use clear, idiomatic Python and prefer readability.
- Keep code examples runnable and add comments for clarity.
